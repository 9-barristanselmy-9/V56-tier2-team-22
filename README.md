Your project's `readme` is as important to success as your code. For
this reason you should put as much care into its creation and maintenance
as you would any other component of the application.

If you are unsure of what should go into the `readme` let this article,
written by an experienced Chingu, be your starting point -

# MediPhase


It's inevitable that at some point in your life you or a loved one will have to undergo some type of surgery - either as an inpatient or an outpatient. In this event you or a companion, depending on who's having the surgery, will be in a hospital waiting room while the surgery is being performed.

Enter MediPhase. MediPhase helps medical teams monitor a patient's surgery journey with ease. MediPhase provides real-time updates on surgical patient status. 

Checked In, Pre-Procedure, In Progress, Closing, Recovery and Complete. 

Simple, secure, and compassionate care at your medical team's fingertips.

## Overview 

As part of Chingu Voyage 56, our team is building MediPhase. 

## Features 

### UI/UX 
// TODO add UML Diagrams and Figma Images here 


### Screens
- [ ] Home Screen 
- [ ] Patient Information Screen
- [ ] Patient Status Update Screen
- [ ] Patient Status Display Screen 
- [ ] Validation and Error Handling


## Folder Structure 

The app uses the following folder structure: 

`/src` - All React source code files in there
`/src/screens` - In this folder, have a subfolder for each visual screen
`/src/components` - Any reusable components that will be used in multiple components/screens
`/src/hooks` - React hooks that we make

## Storage
* As a more frontend-focused app, we're using local storage for any data that needs to be persisted. 
* If any cross-component data sharing is required, we can use React Context API for now.
